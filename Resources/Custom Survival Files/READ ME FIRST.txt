first of all take a look at the file "example God difficulty" to see how the final code should look (this is an example)
now to get your values check "survival help" file it and copy paste them into the file "template"

always write inside "" for example here
survivalCode.stageMusic = "";  => survivalCode.stageMusic = "INSERT VALUE HERE";
never modify anything else in this file, or it's name or location
